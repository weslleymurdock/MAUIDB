# Indexes

LiteDB improves search performance by using indexes on document fields or expressions. Each index stores the value of a specific expression ordered by both value and type. Without an index, LiteDB must execute a query using a full document scan, deserializing every document in the collection.

## Index Implementation

Indexes in LiteDB are implemented using **skip lists**. Skip lists are doubly linked sorted lists with up to 32 levels. They are easy to implement and statistically balanced.

Insert and search operations have an average complexity of *O*(log n). This means that in a collection with 1 million documents, a search operation over an indexed expression will take about 13 steps to find the desired document. If you want to know more about skip lists, [check this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBwUoWpeH_Q).

Given that collections are schema-less, it is possible for an expression to return different data types when applied over different documents. In such cases, the documents will be ordered by the type returned by the indexing expression, according to the table below:

| BSON Type | Order |
| --- | --- |
| MinValue | 1 |
| Null | 2 |
| Int32, Int64, Double, Decimal | 3 |
| String | 4 |
| Document | 5 |
| Array | 6 |
| Binary | 7 |
| ObjectId | 8 |
| Guid | 9 |
| Boolean | 10 |
| DateTime | 11 |
| MaxValue | 12 |

* When comparing documents, the values in the key-value pairs are compared in the order that they appear until a tie is broken.
* When comparing arrays, every position is compared until a tie is broken.
* All numeric values are converted to `Decimal` before comparison.

## Primary key (= auto id)

By default, an index over `_id` is created upon the first insertion.

## EnsureIndex()

Indexes are created via `EnsureIndex`. This method creates the index if it does not exist and does nothing if already exists.

An index can be created over any valid `BsonExpression`.

```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "Address": {
    "Street": "Av. Protasio Alves, 1331",
    "City": "Porto Alegre",
    "Country": "Brazil"
  }
}
```

* You can use `EnsureIndex("Address")` to create an index on the embedded `Address` document.
* `EnsureIndex("Address.Street")` creates an index on the nested `Street` field using dotted notation.
* Indexes operate on `BsonDocument` field names. If you are using a custom `ResolvePropertyName` or `[BsonField]` attribute, reference the resolved document field name rather than the property name. See [Object Mapping](~/object-mapping/index.md).
* You can use a lambda expression to define an index field in a strongly typed collection: `EnsureIndex(x => x.Name)`.
* Indexes are identified by a unique name.

## Multikey indexes

When you create an index on an array field, LiteDB indexes each element so you can search for any value.

```csharp
public class Customer
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string[] Phones { get; set; }
}

var customers = db.GetCollection<Customer>("customers");

customers.Insert(new Customer { Name = "John", Phones = new string[] { "1", "2", "5" } });
customers.Insert(new Customer { Name = "Doe", Phones = new string[] { "1", "8" } });

customers.EnsureIndex(x => x.Phones);

var result = customers.Find(x => x.Phones.Contains("1")); // returns both documents
```

## Expressions

You can create an index based on the result of an expression, including expressions that return multikey values. This allows you to index information that is not stored directly in a single field.

* `collection.EnsureIndex("Name", "LOWER($.Name)")`
* `collection.EnsureIndex("Total", "SUM($.Items[*].Price)")`
* `collection.EnsureIndex("CheapBooks", "LOWER($.Books[@.Price < 20].Title)")`

See [Expressions](~/expressions/index.md) for more details about expressions.

## Limitations

* Even if multiple indexed expressions are used on a query, only one of the indexes is used, with the remaining expressions being filtered using a full scan.
* Index keys must occupy less than 1024 bytes
* Up to 255 indexes per collections, including the `_id` primary key, but limited to 8096 bytes for index definition. Each index uses: `41` bytes + `LEN(name)` + `LEN(expression)`
