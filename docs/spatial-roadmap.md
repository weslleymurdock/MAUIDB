# Spatial Indexing & Geometry Roadmap

## Current State (feat/spatial-C1)

### Architecture Overview
- **Spatial entry point**: LiteDB/Spatial/Spatial.cs centralises mapper registration, Morton `_gh` computation, `_mbb` bounding boxes, and helper APIs (`EnsurePointIndex`, `EnsureShapeIndex`, `Near`, `WithinBoundingBox`, `Within`, `Intersects`, `Contains`).
- **Geometry primitives**: LiteDB/Spatial/GeoShape.cs defines immutable GeoPoint, GeoLineString, and GeoPolygon types that normalise coordinates and validate rings; each exposes a GeoBoundingBox.
- **Geometry engine**: LiteDB/Spatial/Geometry.cs supplies containment/intersection logic (point-in-polygon, segment intersection, hole validation) with numeric tolerance of 1e-9 degrees.
- **GeoJSON layer**: LiteDB/Spatial/GeoJson.cs serialises/deserialises supported shapes, enforces default WGS84 CRS, and raises LiteException on unsupported payloads.
- **Math helpers**: LiteDB/Spatial/GeoMath.cs implements Haversine and simplified Vincenty distances, polar stability handling, and bounding boxes for circles.
- **Index support**: `_gh` holds Morton (Z-order) codes generated by LiteDB/Spatial/SpatialIndexing.cs; `_mbb` stores `[minLat, minLon, maxLat, maxLon]` arrays produced from GeoBoundingBox/LongitudeRange with anti-meridian awareness.
- **Mapper integration**: Computed members are injected through LiteCollection<T>.EntityMapper, ensuring every LiteCollection<T> instance projects `_gh`/`_mbb` without per-collection state.

### Behaviour & Tests
- Coverage resides in LiteDB.Tests/Spatial/SpatialTests.cs (distance ordering, antimeridian bounding boxes, polygon holes, line/polygon intersections, `_gh` recomputation, GeoJSON round-trip, coordinate validation).
- Manual verification command:
```
dotnet test LiteDB.Tests/LiteDB.Tests.csproj -f net8.0 --filter FullyQualifiedName~Spatial --no-restore
```
  Result: 12 spatial tests passed (warnings stem from legacy crypto APIs and nullable annotations elsewhere).

### Strengths
- Unified serialization path bound to the active BsonMapper (supports multiple LiteDatabase instances).
- Strict geometry validation prevents malformed shapes and enforces hole semantics.
- Morton hashing and bounding boxes lay groundwork for indexed searches.
- Anti-meridian safe longitude handling via LongitudeRange and GeoBoundingBox.

### Limitations
- Helper methods still scan entire collections; `_gh` and `_mbb` are not yet used to prune candidates.
- No LINQ or BsonExpression integration for spatial predicates.
- Index precision is static per creation; no adaptive refinement during queries.
- Only 2D geometries supported; altitude/3D requirements unresolved.
- No spatial join operators or nearest-neighbour optimisations beyond brute-force filtering.
- Lacks tooling for retrofitting existing collections with spatial indices.

## Roadmap

### 1. Index-Aware Query Execution (High Priority)
- Translate query shapes (circles, polygons) into `_gh` range windows and `_mbb` filters.
- Hook range scans into the query pipeline to avoid `FindAll()` enumeration.
- Benchmark on large datasets to confirm IO/CPU gains.

### 2. LINQ & Expression Support
- Introduce spatial operators into the BsonExpression engine (e.g., `$near`, `$within`, `$intersects`).
- Extend the LINQ translator to recognise Spatial methods and emit the new operators.

### 3. 3D & Extended Geometry
- Design GeoPoint3D / GeoBoundingBox3D / GeoPolyhedron structures.
- Evaluate 3D Morton hashing and mixed distance metrics.
- Provide opt-in configuration to preserve backward compatibility with 2D collections.

### 4. Precision & Options
- Surface defaults via SpatialOptions (index precision, tolerance, distance formula).
- Persist precision metadata alongside index definitions for smarter range calculations.

### 5. Migration & Tooling
- Offer shell commands or utility APIs to backfill `_gh`/`_mbb` for existing datasets.
- Document migration paths and antimeridian edge cases.

### 6. Performance Tracking
- Add BenchmarkDotNet scenarios targeting Near/Within/Intersects across dataset sizes.
- Monitor allocations and wall-clock time before/after index-aware implementation.

### 7. Documentation & Samples
- Expand docs with tutorials covering spatial CRUD, indexing, and querying patterns.
- Provide sample apps (e.g., REST endpoint performing radius searches).

## Open Questions
- Should `_gh`/`_mbb` remain internal fields or become part of the public query DSL?
- How to guarantee recomputation when the engine is used directly (bypassing LiteCollection<T>)?
- Is the default 52-bit Morton precision sufficient globally, or do we need latitude-aware precision tuning?
- How should spatial helpers interact with transactions and existing query plans?

## Immediate Action Items
1. Draft design for index-backed Near/Within queries including engine hooks.
2. Prototype `_gh` range generation and anti-meridian splitting utilities.
3. Decide on migration tooling scope (shell command vs. programmatic API).
4. Capture current brute-force performance baselines for comparison.

## Test & Validation Log
- 2025-09-28: `dotnet test LiteDB.Tests/LiteDB.Tests.csproj -f net8.0 --filter FullyQualifiedName~Spatial --no-restore`
  - 12 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Warnings: existing nullable annotations, legacy AES PBKDF2 usage, CA2200 rethrows (unchanged by spatial work).
